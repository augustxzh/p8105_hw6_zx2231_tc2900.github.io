### **p8105_hw6_zx2231_tc2900**
<br>


<br>


Since the original dataset is to big for the server, I first subset the data to only include observations ranged from the year of 2000 to the year of 2010, and save the subset to a new csv file named "nynoaadat_2000_2010.csv". The following code was used to perform the subsetting process:
```{r eval = FALSE}
noaa_subset = read_csv("nynoaadat.zip") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  select(year > 1999)
write_csv(noaa_subset, "nynoaadat_2000_2010.csv")
```
